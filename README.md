# Ruby MECH CRAWL
## TECHNICAL INFO
this project is templated from a ruby 3.0.2 skeleton on replit thankfully all gems were easily ported. 
feel free to fork this project to easily build a web scraper with an api (Rails) and maybe even attach a db to it. A service like this costs way too much though so maybe just use this with command line and learn a bit of ruby =) !

PS: Seems like replit is chill with webcrawlers
